# Stellar smart contract

This repository is used as a support for the following video: [Smart contract with Stellar](https://youtu.be/nnwDpfbwVWU).

## Prerequisites

- nodejs v12+ (I haven't tested below)
- funded test accounts as specified in `accounts.sample.json`

## Run the project

You can choose to run the scripts independently (in the `./setup/` folder), or you can run the end to end tests using `npm run test:e2e`
