# Stellar smart contract

This repository is used as a support for the following video: [Smart contract with Stellar](https://youtu.be/nnwDpfbwVWU).

## Prerequisites

- nodejs v12+ (I haven't tested below)
- funded test accounts as specified in `accounts.sample.json`
- installed npm dependencies

You can use the [Stellar Laboratory](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/#account-creator?network=test) to create and fund test accounts.

## Run the project

You can choose to: 
- run the scripts independently (in the `./setup/` folder),
- or run the end-to-end tests using `npm run test:e2e`

## Contribution

Feel free to submit PRs if something's wrong or you see an obvious improvement.
